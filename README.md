# RECONSTRUST-Beyond Excel
Developing python code to process raw csv files exported by Reconstruct, a tool for viewing and acquiring data from image stacks obtained from serial section electron microscopy.

RECONSTRUCT was created in the lab of Dr. Kristen Harris by John Fiala to facilitate the generation of quantitative measurements of nanometer scale anatomical structures in brain tissue. 

More information can be found at the Harris Lab website https://synapseweb.clm.utexas.edu/

Synapseweb is an excellent resource for anyone interested in ultra-neuroanatomy. Lab publications are available as well as links to datasets. 

The site also hosts The Atlas of Ultrastructural Neurocytology by Josef Spacek.
